# the IBPS Programming Language

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program Computer Science course has a very specific Pseudocode specification.
I created the IBPS programming language, which is fully compliant with the IB Pseudocode specification:

- [Approved notation for devleoping pseudocode, the IB Organization](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IB-Pseudocode-rules-more.pdf)
- [Pseudocode in Examinations, the IB Organization](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IB-Pseudocode-rules.pdf)

# the IBPS Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)

The IBPS IDE integrates the IBPS interpreter that can run IB-compliant pseudocode scripts on the browser.

- Visit [ibps.inandioglu.com](https://ibps.inandioglu.com) to use the IBPS IDE.
- or see [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/baris-inandi/ibps) to access the source code.
