# the IBPS Programming Language and IDE

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program Computer Science course has a very specific Pseudocode specification.
I created the IBPS programming language, which is fully compliant with the IB Pseudocode specification:

- [Approved notation for devleoping pseudocode, the IB Organization](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IB-Pseudocode-rules-more.pdf)
- [Pseudocode in Examinations, the IB Organization](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IB-Pseudocode-rules.pdf)

The IBPS IDE is the easiest way to write, run, and share IBPS code:
- Visit [ibps.inandioglu.com](https://ibps.inandioglu.com) to use the IBPS IDE.
- or see [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/baris-inandi/ibps) to see the source code.
